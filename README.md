# 10C Final Project: Voltorb Flip

The eventual goal of this project will be to have a fully-functioning version of the Pok√©mon minigame Voltorb Flip. It is a Minesweeper-esque game where the player flips over face-down cards that are either labeled with numbers or exploding mines ("Voltorbs"). The gameplay involves progressing through levels while amassing as many coins as possible. Within a level, flipping over a number will give the player that many coins to start with, while subsequent numbers multiply the coin total. If the player flips over all numbers, they win and advance to the next level. The mines force a Game Over and take away all coins gained in that round, while resetting the player's level.

I plan to begin writing this project with Visual Studio with standard C++ code. It will rely on console inputs and outputs, and will have to print the gamestate and gameboard after every input. It will not be able to support things such as flagging positions (like in Minesweeper, placing a flag over a spot to indicate possible mines, or a possible number, which is unique to this game) because a text-generated game board will not be able to display that sort of information in a neat way. Once I have a functional game, I will attempt to port the project into Qt. I will add that functionality as well as other possible bonuses, such as additional casino minigames that the series has been known for.

# Process

Throughout the project, I have resisted the urge to type `using namespace std`. As I learned in this course, this could introduce complications if things in `std` are named the same as functions I may want to define.

I first began the project by creating the `GameBoard`, `Card`, and `Indicator` classes.
* `Card`s hold an integer value from 0 to 3, which are randomly generated, and a boolean value that indicates whether or not it is flipped. Non-flipped cards, when printed, display a "?". Flipped cards will display their values.
* `Indicator`s hold two values: the total sum of the row or column it corresponds to, and the number of mines/"Voltorbs", or zeros, in that row or column.
* The `GameBoard` is pretty self-explanatory; it has a default constructor that generates `Card`s with random values, holds a 5x5 grid of `Card`s and also has two vectors of `Indicator`s, and holds the game state. Member functions in that class are responsible for printing the game board as well.

The first commit contains very rudimentary versions of these classes. The `GameBoard` can do nothing but `print()` itself, and cannot interact with the values of the `Card`s or `Indicator`s within them. The `Card`s have limited functionality as well, only being able to be flipped. This is a far cry from the functionality of the Voltorb Flip game, even if I had a working `print()` function.

---

In the next commit, I made several changes.
* I added a `flagged` field to the `Card` class, which allows the flagging functionality from the original game. Players can now flag cards that they suspect are mines (they will print "F" when flagged), and remind themselves to avoid them.
* However, the `GameBoard` is still unable to change `Card` or `Indicator` values, since the relevant values are all private. This is where I reviewed a concept from 10B that was touched on in 10C: the `friend` keyword. Declaring a `friend class X` in the private section of a class allows the class X to access its private members directly. I made both `Card` and `Indicator` have `friend class GameBoard`, which opens the doors for the game to finally function.
* `GameBoard` gains a new member function: `interact(int row, int column, int type = 0)`.
  * The first two fields are self-explanatory: The function takes in a row and column, and interacts with the element that corresponds to both. `type` is a field that tells the function whether the user wants to flip just one card (0), an entire row (1), or an entire column (2), or if they want to flag an element (3), and performs the corresponding action.
  * To differentiate between the types of interactions, rather than using several `if-else` statements, I used the `switch` statement. This is something I remember learning from 10A, but after it was reviewed in 10C I felt confident enough to actually use it in the program. I broke down the options into different cases and had the function take the appropriate action based on what integer was passed into the `type` field.
* To the `GameBoard` class, I added three values: `int unneededFlips`, `int flippedCards`, and `bool victory`. These are crucial for the game to function.
  * Since the scoring in Voltorb Flip is based on multiplication, you don't actually need to flip over any `Card`s with value 1 to win. If you have a nonzero score, it'll be multiplied by the value on the card, which means that flipping over a 1 actually doesn't do anything unless it's the first card you flip (and even then, you would still need to flip over all the 2's and 3's to win anyway).
  * The default constructor for `GameBoard` thus goes through the 2D array and notes all of the 0's and 1's, and assigns this value to `unneededFlips`.
  * `flippedCards` tracks the number of non-0 and 1 cards that the player flips.
  * The stopping condition is set to be `25 - unneededFlips`. If at any point the game detects that the player has flipped this number of non-0/1 cards, `interact(...)` will set `victory` to `true`.

However, I noticed that sometimes the game would not end properly; sometimes it would end too early, and sometimes it would never end even if I had flipped over all of the correct cards. This is because the game did not check to see if a card has already been flipped, which is problematic if a row and column flip intersect at a non-0/1 value, as it would count that card twice. This was easily fixed in the next commit:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  			if (!board[row - 1][i].get_flipped()) result *= board[row - 1][i].get_value();
 +			if ((board[row - 1][i].get_value() > 1) && !board[row - 1][i].get_flipped()) flippedCards++;
  			board[row - 1][i].flipped = true;
 -			if (board[row - 1][i].get_value() > 1) flippedCards++;
  		}
```
and the same was done for columns, and the problem was fixed.

I also learned about the function `system("CLS")` while writing the main function. I did not want to have several game boards cluttering the console, and such I looked for a way to clear the screen every time a card was changed. Although this function was never covered in any programming class here, it fit the role perfectly, and as such I used it frequently in the program.

After learning about lambda functions and the `for_each` function, I wanted to implement one into my project to possibly cut down on the number of explicit `for` loops I had to write. However, I found that in most cases, this was not very useful. Most of my `for` loops were nested, and manipulated array values instead of values in a defined container class, which means that I couldn't use `for_each`. However, I found one instance where I could use this: the printing of `vector<Indicator> columnSums`. I replaced the loop (which printed the current value at the specified `WIDTH - 2`) with this line of code:

```
for_each(columnSums.begin(), columnSums.end(), [](Indicator x) { x.print(WIDTH - 2); });
```

and the intended functionality was still there.

The game's full functionality is now present. The inputs are all controlled by the console, and the user can now play through the game without any problems. However, a problem arises where the number of coins that the player can initially get can skyrocket to huge values (exceeding 10,000), even in the first round. To remedy this and provide incentive to keep playing, I'm introducing a level system, where higher-leveled boards produce more 2's and 3's than lower-leveled ones, capping at level 7.

To do this, I changed the default constructor for `Card` to be able to take an integer argument. This integer represents the current level of the game, and the rates for 0-3 will change based on this level. Once again, I use the `switch` statement for cases 1 through 7 to provide this functionality.

The `GameBoard` default constructor is now able to take an integer argument as well: `playerLevel`, which is used to construct all of the cards in the 2D array. Due to the leveling system, it may often be the case that the board is generated with 0 mines (which is basically free coins), or 25 unneeded flips (which is a free level-up). To counteract this, I've added a check to the game such that if a board is generated that matches either of these criteria, the constructor will generate another board.

I have also decided that I may not port this project to Qt.
